                <b>Good UI Design:</b>
                <br>
                Facebook, Google, YouTube etc. are all examples of Good UI design. They are easy to navigate, they look nice and nothing is too complicated about it. Good UI Designs should be easy, enjoyable, and pleasurable.

                <br>
                <b>Bad UI Design:</b>
                <br>
                Blinkee.com is an example of a Bad UI Design. It looks static, its elements seems inconsitent. It is not pleasurable to look at and navigate around.                
                <br>
                <br>
                -An overall purpose of the interface is to be able to navigate through different pages and components of the website. For exmaple in YouTube, you can easily navigate
                through the pages and search videos and songs. The website is not complicated. YouTube has Light and Dark theme where users can pick their favorite one.
                <br>
                -The good aspect I find about YouTube is, it does spellcheck and if you write something wrong it directs you to nearest correct answer. it also allows us to create our
                own account so we can subscribe to out favorite channels and watch the videos we like. YouTube dosen't allow you to post Copyrighted content on it to protect and credit
                artist's works.
                <br>
                -The YouTube UI fulfills its objective by searching and playing videos. We can like, share, and comment on videos and can stay connected to the community. We get to
                understand and share opinions on YouTube.
